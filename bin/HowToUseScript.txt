On ALL the servers there is now a new tool for encrypting Plain Text passwords. 
In the event a Developer wants to put an ID/Password into a configuration file you would use this tool.

It is located in:
D:\opt\Encryption

There are two files in it:
encryption-utils-2.0.0.jar
EncryptPW.bat

From command line just call:
EncryptPW.bat

This will give you the "Usage".

[USAGE]: EncryptPW.bat arg1 arg2 arg3
arg1 = Command (encrypt / decrypt / generatekey)
arg2 = Password / KeyFileName (if generatekey)
arg3 = Key File Length (Possible values: 128, 192, 256)
Note: You must enclose any password to encrypt or decrypt in double Quotes
       Example: "mypassword"


Note: You MUST enclose the password to Encrypt or Decrypt in double quotes! 
DOS has a nasty habit of converting special characters, like "=" to a " " (equal sign to a space).


To Encrypt a plain text password call the script like this:
EncryptPW.bat encrypt "mypasswordtoencrypt"

This will output (the value after the ": " is the encrypted password):
The Encrypted value of mypasswordtoencrypt is: vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI=


To Encrypt a plain text password using a specified Encryption Key File call the script like this:
EncryptPW.bat encryptwithkey C:\temp\MySecretKeyFile.key "mypasswordtoencrypt"

This will output (the value after the ": " is the encrypted password):
The Encrypted value of mypasswordtoencrypt is: vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI=


To Decrypt a plain text password call the script like this (password below is the encrypted version of "mypasswordtoencrypt" from above):
EncryptPW.bat decrypt "vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI="

This will output (the value after the ": " is the decrypted password):
The Decrypted value of vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI= is: mypasswordtoencrypt


To Decrypt a plain text password using a specified Encryption Key File call the script like this (password below is the encrypted version of "mypasswordtoencrypt" from above):
EncryptPW.bat decryptwithkey C:\temp\MySecretKeyFile.key "vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI="

This will output (the value after the ": " is the decrypted password):
The Decrypted value of vmGB5Cx1sA7CRYxKmxx+IF36sE+K8TyStrUx+DtBVGI= is: mypasswordtoencrypt

Note: The decrypted password should MATCH the plain text one that was originally encrypted.

As a "check" when you encrypt a password I would call the decrypt also to verify the decrypted version of the encrypted password matches.

To Generate your own AES Encrpytion Key (Key File) call the script like this (Possible values for the third argument: 128, 192, 256):
EncryptPW.bat generatekey C:\temp\MySecretKeyFile.key 256
